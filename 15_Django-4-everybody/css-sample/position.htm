<h1>Positioning</h1>
<div>
(1) By default, blocks of text
just folow each other 
</div>
<div>
(2) One after another.
</div>
<div style="position: relative; left: -20px; top: 20px;">
(3) A relative position moves a block away from where it would normally
lay out.
</div>
<div>
(4) And text after that just lays out.  So be somewhat
careful with relative.
</div>
<div style="border-color: green; position: fixed; bottom: 20px; left: 30%;">
(5) Fixed text is relative to the <em>window</em>.
It maintains its position even when the window is resized
or scrolled. 
A <a href="index.htm">link</a> that never goes away.
</div>
<div style="border-color: orange; position: absolute; top: 40px; left: 30%;">
(6) Absolute text is relative to  its parent element.
In this case the <strong>div</strong> is positioned
relative to the <strong>body</strong> tag.
It maintains its position even when the window is resized
or scrolled.
</div>
<div>
(7) In a sense, the <strong>fixed</strong> and
<strong>absolute</strong> elements are 
"plucked out" of the the normal render stream 
and as such take up no vertical space.
there is not any padding or margin
left behind by these tags.
</div>
<div style="border-color: yellow; position: relative; left: -1000px;">
(8) Where did this text go?
</div>
<div style="border-color: yellow;">
(9) Why can't I see (8) but it took up space?
</div>
