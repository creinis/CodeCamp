<h1>A Header</h1>
<p>
You put a set of rules in a &lt;style&gt;
tag, and they are applied to parts
of the documents that match the selectors.
</p>
<p>
After a while we end up with far too many
CSS rules to put in the &lt;head&gt; area
of each document.  A simpler way to include
a large number of CSS rules is to put them 
in a separate file and 
<a href="include.htm">&rArr; include that file</a>
in each of the pages.

<!-- Ignore this for now :) -->
<p style="border-style: none; position:fixed; bottom: 10px; right: 10px;">
Go back to the 
<a href="index.htm">Starting page</a>.

</body>
