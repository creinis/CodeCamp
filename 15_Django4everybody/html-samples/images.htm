<h1>How images look </h2>
<p>
<img src="medium.png"/>
</p>
<p>
Sometimes you put the image all by itself in a paragraph.
If we knew CSS, we could center the image in the page.
Don't be tempted use the <strong>center</strong> tag as 
it is deprecated.

Images can be <img src="tiny.png"/> right 
in the middle of text like a character.
And we can even make an image a clickable
<a href="lists.htm"><img src="tiny.png"/></a>
link to another page.
