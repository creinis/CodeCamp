The 3 Pillars of API Security

Governance:
    developing secure APIs 

    Benefits: 
        consistency
        settings expectations
        estabilishing standard processes
        enforcing Security
    Awareness:
        know your API
        know your data
        know your risks (identify, assess, probability, impact, mitigation)
    Policy:
        engeneering processes
        API documentation (OpenAPI Specification - Swagger / is the market standard)
        style guides (Design Guides: Promove Governance, Consistency)
            AuthenticationAuthorization
            Naming Conventions
            Error Codes
            Versioning
            Units, Formats, Standards


Testing:
    Ensuring APIs are free of flaws 

    Standard Playbook:
        cross-site scripting, injections, buffer overflow
        Important to run these tests to avoid bot-based attacks
        API breaches rarely exploit these
        Major breaches typcally business logic flaws
    
    API Security:
        unsecured endpoints
        authentication exploits
        enumeration
        App DOS, rate limiting
        Missing TLS, SSL issues
        Injection, fuzzing
        Fuzzing, input validation
        Server-side resource forgery
        Server properties leaks
    
    Data Security:
        Access control
        Excessive data exposure
        Sensitive data exposure
        Personal, Health, Bank data
        File, directory exposure
        Encrypting at rest
        data exfiltration

    Business Logic:
        Cross-account Access
        API function abuse
        role-based access control
        pen-Testing
        

Monitoring:
    Detecting threats in production
