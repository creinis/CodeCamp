Process 
    Data Extraction >> Data Cleaning >> Data Wrangling >> Analysis >> Action 

Data Extraction:
    SQL 
    Scrapping 
    File Format (CSV, JSON, XML)
    Consultinf APIs 
    Buying Data 
    Distributed Databases 

Data Cleaning: 
    Missing values and empty data 
    Data imputation
    Incorrect types 
    Incorrect or invalid values 
    Outliers and non relevant data 
    Statistical sanitization

Data Wrangling:
    Hieranchical Data 
    Handling categorical data 
    Reshaping and transforming structures 
    Indexing data for quick access 
    Merging, combining and joining data 

Analysis:
    Exploration
    Building statistical models 
    Visualization and representations 
    Correlations vs Causation analysis 
    Reporting 

Action:
    Building Machine Learning Models 
    Feature Engeneering 
    Moving ML info production 
    Building ETL pipelines 
    Live dashboard and reporting 
    Decision making and real-time tests 


Python Ecosystem: (libraries)
    PANDAS: the cornertone of our Data Analysis job with Python 
    Matplotlib: The fundational library for visualizations. Other libraries we'll use will be built on top of matplotlib 
    Numpy: The numeric library that serves as the foundation of all calculations in Python 
    Seaborn: A statistical visualization tool built on top of matplotlib 
    Statsmodels: A library with many advanced statiscal functions 
    Scipy: Advanced scientific computing, including functions for optimization, linear algebra, imagem processing and much more 
    Scikit-learn: The most popular machine learning library for Python(not deep learning)
